- =/character= body must be:

  #+begin_src typescript :exports both :results output 
    {
      name: "Name with letters and or spaces",
      alignment: "Sith" | "Jedi" | "Grey Jedi"

* Test error
After running the tests I'm getting this error:

#+begin_src text :exports both :results output 
	Ran all test suites.
Jest did not exit one second after the test run has completed.

This usually means that there are asynchronous operations that weren't stopped in your tests. Consider running Jest with `--detectOpenHandles` to troubleshoot this issue.
